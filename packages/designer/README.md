# @gable/designer

The Gable Designer: inspect a running Gable app, mount one component in isolation, and see language-service problems on the
canvas. Private (not published).

```
npm run build -w packages/designer          # agent + backend (tsc) and the shell (vite)
node packages/designer/dist/server/cli.js examples/todomvc      # then open the printed URL in a browser
packages/designer/src-tauri/target/debug/gable-designer.exe examples/todomvc   # the desktop window (cargo build in src-tauri)
```

Parts:

- `src/agent`: the dev-only **Preview agent**, injected into the project's pages by `src/server/vite-plugin.ts`. Reports over
  `postMessage`; dormant unless the Designer framed the page (`src/protocol.ts`: versioned, nonce and origin checked).
- `src/server`: the Node backend (the project's own Vite is spawned with a wrapper config; nothing is written to the project),
  node-to-source mapping (`source.ts`), the language-service run (`analyze-*.ts`), the HTTP API (token and Host checked).
- `shell`: the Designer UI, itself a Gable app built from gable-ui components copied in with the gable-ui CLI.
- `src-tauri`: the thin Rust desktop host (window and process lifetime only).

Scenarios are `*.scenes.ts` files beside a component (see `examples/todomvc/src/components/todo-item.scenes.ts`); the same
files run under `@gable/testing` with `mountScene`.

## Device emulation and frames

The canvas shows up to six **Frames**: iframes sized in CSS pixels (preset, custom, or rotated), scaled down to fit the board
(Fit, or 50/75/100%). Each Frame is its own app instance with its own session nonce and its own origin (`localhost` for the
first, `f1.localhost`, `f2.localhost`... for the rest, all loopback), so frames do not share storage and Chromium gives each
its own renderer process. That last part matters for emulation: over CDP, touch, pointer/hover and media features are
process-wide, so two frames on one site could not be emulated differently.

The device bar edits the selected frame (`FrameSet.selected`, `selectedWidth` and `selectedBreakpoint` in
`shell/src/app/frames.ts`; Tailwind mode reads these). Presets (built in, plus ones you save) and the frame layout are kept
per project in the user data directory (`GABLE_DESIGNER_DATA`, else `%APPDATA%` / `~/Library/Application Support` /
`$XDG_DATA_HOME`), not in the project and not in browser storage (the desktop window's origin changes on every launch).
**Sync** repeats clicks, typing, scrolling and Enter/Escape from the frame you use in the others. **Open in browser** opens
the same page of the same dev server in the system browser.

| Emulation | Windows desktop app (CDP) | Elsewhere |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Width, height, rotation | CSS on the iframe | same |
| Device pixel ratio | reported to scripts (`devicePixelRatio`); resolution media queries and image density follow the screen | same, labelled |
| Touch | CDP touch emulation (coarse pointer, no hover, touch points) plus synthetic touch events | synthetic `touchstart/move/end` from mouse events only, labelled |
| Color scheme, reduced motion, user agent | CDP | unsupported, labelled |

CDP is a Windows-only path: the Rust host passes `--remote-debugging-port=<free port>` to WebView2 (`additional_browser_args`;
the environment variable is ignored) and `--cdp-port` to the backend, which is the CDP client (`src/server/cdp.ts`). Set
`GABLE_CDP_PORT=<n>` to choose the port or `GABLE_CDP_PORT=0` to turn it off. The port listens on loopback and gives full control
of the webview to any local process, so it is only enabled in the desktop app. A frame is found as its own `iframe` CDP target
by reading the nonce the agent keeps in the frame's `window.name`.

The driven check (needs a built Designer and Edge/Chromium with a debugging port, or the Tauri window):

```
node packages/designer/e2e/device-check.mjs --port <cdp port> --shell 127.0.0.1:<designer port> [--no-cdp] [--shot dir]
```
