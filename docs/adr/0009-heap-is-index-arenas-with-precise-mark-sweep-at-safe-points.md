# 9. The heap is a set of index arenas collected by precise mark-sweep at interpreter safe points

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The spec (`docs/js-engine-spec.md`, section 5) asks for a precise, non-moving, single-threaded collector, scoped rooting for the embedder, no collection during a Gable frame, and `unsafe` confined to the heap and GC modules with Miri and sanitizer jobs in CI. The usual Rust designs are `Rc`/`Gc` smart pointers with tracing (Boa's `gc` crate), raw pointers behind a safe facade, or index-based arenas (Nova). Each trades allocator speed, collector precision, API ergonomics and the amount of `unsafe` differently.

## Decision

- **Index arenas, one per heap type** (`heap.rs`: objects, strings, symbols, BigInts, environments, shapes). A `Value` is a small `Copy` enum: primitives inline, heap values as `u32` arena indices. Every arena is a `Vec<Option<T>>` with a free list and a mark bit per slot. Access through a dead slot panics instead of aliasing, so a stale id is caught as an engine bug.
- **No `unsafe` in the heap, the collector or anywhere else in the VM.** The spec permits `unsafe` in these modules; we found we did not need it, and the invariants that would have justified it (ids valid only while reachable from a root, and only until the next collection) hold without it because the arenas are plain vectors. The only `unsafe` in the workspace is in the QuickJS adapter's FFI.
- **Precise mark-sweep at safe points only** (`gc.rs`). Roots are the frames and the shared register file, the scoped root stack used by built-ins, the host handle table, realms, interned names and well-known symbols, the symbol registry, the job queue, module records and shape keys. Interned strings are weak. Collection runs from `Vm::maybe_collect` between instructions and only when no native frame is on the Rust stack, so Rust locals in built-ins never observe a collection. Allocation never collects; it accumulates `allocated_since_gc` and the next safe point decides.
- **Pacing.** The threshold is twice the live size after a collection, with an 8 MiB floor; the host can request a collection (`gc_requested`) and set a memory limit that turns into an out-of-memory fault at the next safe point.
- **Stress mode.** `GABLE_GC_STRESS=1` collects at every safe point. It is the mode the GC CI job runs the unit tests and a test262 slice under; it exists to find missing roots, which are the only class of GC bug this design admits.
- **Incremental slices and host-scheduled collection** (spec section 5) are deferred: the arena design does not preclude them (mark bits are per slot, the mark stack is explicit), but they are not needed until the engine runs inside Gable's frame loop (M9).

## Consequences

- Heap values are not pointers, so there is an index-and-bounds check on every access; the object model offsets this with shapes and, in M3, inline caches. If profiling in M9 shows the arenas as a cost, the switch to a pointer-based heap is confined to `heap.rs`, `value.rs` and the tracer.
- Non-moving: fragmentation is handled by the free lists, not compaction. The spec's "leave room for a generational or moving collector" is satisfied by hiding slot identity behind the `*Id` types.
- Rust code that holds an id across an allocation is correct as long as no safe point intervenes; a built-in that calls back into JavaScript must root its ids on the scoped root stack. Miri exercises this discipline in CI together with the stress mode.
- `WeakRef`, `FinalizationRegistry` and module-record collection (M4, M5) plug into the sweep phase as weak tables; the finalization callbacks are queued as `Job::Call` host tasks, never run during the sweep.
