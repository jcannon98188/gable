# Gable JS engine: specification

The spec for the work of building the **Gable engine**: the JavaScript engine Gable owns, written in Rust, that the Gable Native **Host runtime** embeds. It consolidates the decisions made in the Gable Native design map (TASK-99): architecture (TASK-99.6), engine prior art (TASK-99.10) and engine design (TASK-99.11), plus the four implementation-shape decisions made when this spec was written. Rationale for owning an engine is in [ADR 0004](adr/0004-gable-native-owns-its-javascript-engine-in-rust.md). Terms (Host runtime, Engine interface, Gable engine) are defined in `GLOSSARY.md`.

The implementation tasks are children of the Backlog task "Gable JS engine" and follow the milestones at the end of this document.

## 1. Goals and non-goals

Goals:

- Run full ES2025 TypeScript output and third-party code (RxJS and the like) correctly: the conformance gate is test262.
- Pure Rust, no JIT, one build on Windows, macOS, Linux and Android. No hardened-runtime JIT entitlement on macOS and no JIT restrictions on Android.
- Be an embeddable engine whose host-object, garbage-collection, module and debugging hooks fit Gable (retained native node tree, module re-loading for HMR).
- Replace the adopted interim engine (QuickJS-NG first, Boa as the alternative) when the switch-over rule in section 11 is met.

Non-goals for v1: a JIT; multi-threaded sharing of heaps; Workers; Stage 3 proposals; a DOM or any browser global (the engine never provides one); a profiler and heap profiler (later).

The maintainer cannot test on macOS. Everything is pure Rust with no platform-specific code in the engine, and macOS is verified by CI runners. Never add platform-specific engine code without a macOS path.

## 2. Language target

- Full ES2025 (ECMA-262 16th edition) plus Annex B, except `IsHTMLDDA`.
- `eval` and `new Function` are supported, with a host switch (`HostEnsureCanCompileStrings`) that can turn them off.
- Later editions and Stage 4 features arrive behind feature flags. Stage 3 proposals are out.
- **Intl**: the engine implements ECMA-402 (`DateTimeFormat`, `NumberFormat`, `PluralRules`, `Collator`, `Segmenter`, `ListFormat`, `RelativeTimeFormat`, `DisplayNames`, `Locale`) and the `toLocale*` methods, on ICU4X behind a seam (ICU4X is shared with Parley, the text stack). Locale data is trimmed to the app's locales. Gable core uses `DateTimeFormat`, `NumberFormat` and `PluralRules`; those come first.
- **Threads, `SharedArrayBuffer` and `Atomics`**: an engine instance is single-threaded with its own heap. test262's multi-agent tests need several agents sharing a buffer, so they are listed in the exclusions file with that reason. Multi-agent support (shared backing stores) is a later milestone. `SharedArrayBuffer` and `Atomics` single-agent behaviour is implemented.

## 3. Execution model

- Handwritten parser producing an AST; early errors implemented in the parser or a following pass.
- Single-pass compiler from AST to register-based bytecode with an accumulator (Ignition and Hermes style): fixed operand widths, compact instructions.
- Scope resolution at compile time into slots (closures capture slot environments); `with` and sloppy direct `eval` fall back to dynamic lookup.
- Object model: shapes (hidden classes, as in Boa, V8 and JSC) with inline caches in the interpreter.
- No JIT in v1; leave room in the bytecode and object model for a later tier.
- Bytecode is serializable, so production bundles can ship precompiled code. The format is versioned and rejected on mismatch.
- Generators and async functions are implemented as resumable frames in the interpreter, not as threads or stack copies.

## 4. Strings

Dual representation: one-byte (Latin-1) and two-byte (UTF-16 code units) strings, as in V8, JSC and QuickJS. JS strings can contain lone surrogates, so WTF-8 is rejected (it makes `length` and indexing expensive). Concatenation builds ropes that flatten on demand. Property keys are interned atoms. Symbols and BigInts are separate heap types.

## 5. Garbage collection

- Precise, non-moving mark-sweep on a single thread with size-class allocation.
- Embedder values are rooted through a scoped root stack: host code holds values only inside a root scope or through an explicit persistent handle.
- Incremental slices, scheduled by the host between Gable flushes so collection does not interrupt a frame.
- `WeakRef` and `FinalizationRegistry` are supported; finalization callbacks run as host tasks, never during collection.
- Module records are heap objects and are collected when unreachable (needed for HMR).
- The heap interface hides the collector's strategy so a generational or moving collector can follow.
- Host classes register trace hooks so the collector sees references held by host objects.
- `unsafe` is allowed only in the heap and GC modules. Every use carries a comment stating the invariant it relies on. CI runs the test suite under Miri where it is practical and under address and undefined-behaviour sanitizers.

## 6. Regular expressions

ECMAScript regex semantics (backtracking, lookbehind, named groups, the `v` flag, Unicode property escapes, Annex B legacy syntax) differ from Rust's `regex` crate. A Gable regex engine lives in its own crate behind a seam.

The first task of that crate is an evaluation of `regress` (the ES-compliant Rust regex crate Boa uses) against the relevant test262 tests (`built-ins/RegExp`, `language/literals/regexp`, `annexB`) and the performance of pathological patterns. If it passes, adopt it behind the seam; otherwise write our own engine. The decision is recorded as a short ADR.

## 7. Engine interface

The Gable-owned boundary the Host runtime codes against. It is satisfied by the Gable engine and by the adopted interim engine (a QuickJS-NG adapter first). It lives in its own crate, with a conformance test kit that both adapters must pass.

Required capabilities:

- Evaluate scripts and modules. A module loader hook resolves static imports from the app bundle and dynamic `import()`.
- A host-driven job queue: the engine enqueues promise jobs and the host runs them after every host task (a Gable flush ends with a microtask checkpoint).
- A promise-rejection tracker (`HostPromiseRejectionTracker`) routed to the Gable error handler.
- Host-supplied timers: the engine has no event loop and no clock-driven callbacks of its own.
- Interrupt and memory limits.
- Realm creation.
- Bytecode load and save.
- Host classes with trace hooks, and host functions callable from JS.
- Renderer node handles are plain integers (never GC references), so the retained node tree lives in Rust and JS holds integer handles.
- A hook for `import.meta` (HMR needs `import.meta.hot` provided by the host).
- Module re-loading under a new specifier, so a changed module can be evaluated again while the old record is collected once unreachable. The engine has no hot-update primitive: HMR logic lives in JavaScript.
- Source positions per bytecode offset and script source retrieval, for the debugger and for source-mapped exceptions.

The Rust API shapes (traits, handle types, error types) are the implementing agent's to design in milestone M0, recorded as an ADR, and reviewed against both the Gable engine and the QuickJS-NG adapter before M2 starts.

## 8. Host globals

Provided by the host layer, never the engine:

- The WinterCG baseline: `console`, `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, `queueMicrotask`, `URL`, `URLSearchParams`, `fetch`, `AbortController`, `AbortSignal`, `TextEncoder`, `TextDecoder`, `performance`, `structuredClone`, `crypto.getRandomValues`.
- Plus `globalThis`, `self`, `EventTarget`, `Event`, `CustomEvent`, `MessageChannel` and a small `navigator` (`userAgent` identifying Gable Native, `language`, `languages`, `onLine`, `hardwareConcurrency`).
- `window`, `document` and `location` are not defined by default: they would imply a second node tree behind the Renderer, DOM-scale size, and browser-detection libraries misfire on them. An opt-in DOM-compat package is future work (fog on the design map) and is not part of this spec.

The engine crate itself contains no host globals beyond the ECMAScript standard library (and `console` hooks supplied through the engine interface). Host globals are implemented in the host-runtime effort, not here; this spec only requires the engine interface to be sufficient for them.

## 9. Debugging

- A debugger interface in the engine: source positions per bytecode offset, breakpoints, stepping, frame and scope inspection, async stacks, script source.
- A separate Gable-owned adapter to the Chrome DevTools Protocol in its own crate.
- First version covers: console, source-mapped exceptions, breakpoints, stepping and `evaluate`. Profiler and heap profiler later.
- The interim engine has no inspector; interim debugging is handled by the dev-loop work (TASK-99.13), not here.

## 10. Crate layout

A Cargo workspace under `native/engine/` (the host runtime lives beside it under `native/`):

| Crate | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `gable-engine-api` | The engine interface (section 7) and its conformance test kit. Shared with the QuickJS-NG adapter. |
| `gable-js-parser` | Lexer, parser, AST, early errors, source maps input. |
| `gable-js-compiler` | AST to bytecode, scope analysis, bytecode format and serialization. |
| `gable-js-vm` | Interpreter, object model and shapes, heap and GC, built-ins, jobs, modules. |
| `gable-js-regex` | The regex seam and its engine (adopted `regress` or our own). |
| `gable-js-intl` | The ICU4X bridge and ECMA-402 built-ins support. |
| `gable-js-debugger` | The debugger interface and its implementation hooks. |
| `gable-js-cdp` | The CDP adapter. |
| `gable-js-test262` | The test262 runner, harness glue and exclusions file handling. |
| `gable-engine-quickjs` | The interim adapter (may live in the host-runtime effort; its conformance-kit pass is an M0 deliverable). |

Crate boundaries may be adjusted when implementation shows a better split; record the change in an ADR. `unsafe` is confined as in section 5. Minor implementation choices (number formatting and parsing algorithms, Date parsing, BigInt arithmetic, hashing, allocator details, the exact bytecode instruction set) belong to the implementing agent: choose, and record each non-obvious choice as a short ADR in `docs/adr/`.

## 11. Conformance gate and switch-over

test262 is the correctness gate:

- Pin a test262 commit (a submodule or a fetched pinned revision) and derive the feature list for the ES2025 cut from `features.txt` plus the pinned commit, because `features.txt` has no edition field.
- Run each test as the suite requires: strict mode twice (once sloppy, once strict, except `onlyStrict`, `noStrict` and `raw` flags).
- Included: `test/built-ins`, `test/language`, `test/annexB`. Excluded: `test/staging`. `test/intl402` is reported separately; the first switch-over gate covers only the Intl subset Gable uses.
- Exclusions live in one checked-in file with a reason per entry (for example `SharedArrayBuffer multi-agent`, `IsHTMLDDA`, a Stage 3 feature). An exclusion without a reason fails the runner.
- The pass rate may never regress: CI compares against a checked-in baseline.
- CI runs on Windows, Linux and macOS (the engine is pure Rust, so the same suite runs everywhere), on every pull request that touches the engine.

test262 does not measure performance, memory, the debugger or embedding behaviour, so the switch-over rule adds its own gates. The Gable engine becomes the default only when all of these hold:

1. Every included test262 test passes except documented exclusions, with a target of zero such exceptions.
2. Gable's own test suites (core, router, forms, store and the rest) pass under it.
3. A Gable benchmark set is at parity with the interim engine within a tolerance: signal churn, RxJS pipelines, the template interpreter, list diffing, and gable-ui bundle startup. The tolerance is set after measuring the interim engine's baseline (milestone M9 starts by recording it).
4. The debugger covers the first version (section 9).
5. The interim engine stays selectable for one release after the switch.

## 12. Milestones

Each milestone is a Backlog task under "Gable JS engine", with acceptance criteria tied to the test262 gate where it applies. They are ordered; a later milestone depends on the one before it unless noted.

| # | Milestone | Done when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M0 | Workspace, engine interface crate, test262 runner, CI | The workspace builds on three OSes; the runner pins test262, applies feature filtering and the exclusions file, and reports per-directory pass rates against a baseline; the engine interface exists with a conformance kit that the QuickJS-NG adapter passes. |
| M1 | Parser and AST | The parser accepts every test262 parse-positive test in scope and rejects every parse-negative (early-error) test in scope. |
| M2 | Compiler, interpreter core and GC | Statements, expressions, functions, closures, exceptions and the garbage collector run the `language` tests that need only core built-ins; GC stress and Miri jobs run in CI. |
| M3 | Objects, shapes and core built-ins | Inline caches work; `Object`, `Function`, `Array`, `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, `Symbol`, `Math`, `JSON`, `Error` and the reflection built-ins pass their test262 directories. |
| M4 | Promises, jobs, generators, async functions, modules | Promise jobs run through the host-driven queue; iterators, generators, async functions, async generators, static and dynamic modules, top-level await and `import.meta` pass their test262 directories; module re-loading and module-record collection are tested. |
| M5 | Regex, Date, collections, typed arrays, Proxy, Reflect, BigInt | The regex seam decision is recorded (ADR); `RegExp`, `Date`, `Map`, `Set`, `WeakMap`, `WeakSet`, `WeakRef`, `FinalizationRegistry`, `ArrayBuffer`, typed arrays, `DataView`, `Proxy`, `Reflect`, `BigInt` and `SharedArrayBuffer`/`Atomics` (single-agent) pass their test262 directories. |
| M6 | Intl on ICU4X | The ECMA-402 built-ins and `toLocale*` methods pass the `intl402` directories for `DateTimeFormat`, `NumberFormat` and `PluralRules` first, then the rest; locale-data trimming is configurable. |
| M7 | Engine-interface adapter and bytecode serialization | The Gable engine passes the engine-interface conformance kit; precompiled bytecode round-trips and a version mismatch is rejected; the host can drive jobs, timers, limits and realms. |
| M8 | Debugger and CDP adapter | Breakpoints, stepping, scope inspection, async stacks, source-mapped exceptions, console and `evaluate` work through the CDP adapter, verified with a CDP client test. |
| M9 | Gable test suites and the benchmark gate | The benchmark set exists and the interim baseline is recorded; Gable's own test suites run under the engine in CI; the switch-over rule in section 11 is evaluated and the result reported (not self-approved: the maintainer decides the switch). |

Performance work (interpreter dispatch, inline caches, string and shape tuning, GC pacing) runs alongside M2 to M9; the benchmarks are introduced in M9 but the agent should keep micro-benchmarks as each area lands.

## 13. Working agreements for the implementing agent

- Write the failing test262 tests first where possible; the runner is the ground truth.
- Do not claim a milestone done while its test262 directories have unexplained failures. List remaining failures in the exclusions file with a reason, or fix them.
- Record non-obvious choices as short ADRs in `docs/adr/`. Use the project glossary's terms.
- Never edit Backlog files directly; use the `backlog` CLI.
- Nothing in the engine may depend on a platform; if a platform-specific path seems necessary, stop and raise it, because the maintainer cannot test on macOS.
- Prior-art research is on the branch `research/js-engine-design-and-test262` (`research/js-engine-design-and-test262.md`): Boa, Nova, Brimstone, Ignition, Hermes, JSC LLInt, QuickJS, and test262 runner mechanics.
