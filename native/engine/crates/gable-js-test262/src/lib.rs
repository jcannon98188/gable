//! The test262 runner for engines behind the Gable engine interface.
//!
//! Layout:
//! - [`metadata`]: frontmatter parsing
//! - [`features`]: the ES2025 feature cut
//! - [`exclusions`]: the exclusions file (every rule carries a reason)
//! - [`runner`]: one test, per INTERPRETING.md
//! - [`suite`]: discovery, parallel runs, report, baseline comparison
//!
//! The pinned test262 commit lives in `PIN` next to the crate; `test262 fetch`
//! checks it out into `native/engine/test262/`.
