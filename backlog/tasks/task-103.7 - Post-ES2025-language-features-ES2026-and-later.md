## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Implement the post-ES2025 features the engine currently excludes (see native/engine/crates/gable-js-test262/post-es2025-features.txt): Array.fromAsync, Error.isError, Math.sumPrecise, Uint8Array base64 and hex, JSON.parse source text access, iterator sequencing, Atomics.pause, upsert (Map getOrInsert), iterator chunking, iterator includes, joint iteration, and explicit resource management (using, DisposableStack). Temporal is separate. Model: Opus.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Each listed feature passes its test262 tests at the pinned commit, is removed from post-es2025-features.txt, and the gable and --precompile baselines show no regressions
- [ ] #2 Features still at Stage 3 are skipped with a recorded reason; the list is reviewed when the test262 pin moves
