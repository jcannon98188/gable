## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The Gable JS engine (native/engine, TASK-100) is planned to become its own release outside Gable once M9 lands and a few optimization passes are done (see TASK-100.12). Extraction is only a mechanical repository split if nothing under the engine workspace depends on Gable code, vocabulary or build setup. M7 (TASK-100.8) is where the engine-interface adapter lands, so the boundary rule has to be in place before it, and applied as M7 to M9 land. The engine-api crate (gable-engine-api, ADR 0006) is the only surface shared with Gable; the host trait is how Gable reaches in. The Intl seam (ADR 0015) and the regex seam (ADR 0013) are the pattern to follow.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 No crate in native/engine depends on any Gable crate, template vocabulary or renderer type; Gable-specific adaptation lives on the Gable side of the host trait
- [ ] #2 A CI job builds and tests the engine workspace from a checkout containing only native/engine (for example a copy into a temporary directory), proving it builds standalone
- [ ] #3 Engine-crate names, docs and public identifiers do not assume Gable (Gable may appear in ADR context and history, not in APIs); a short note in docs/js-engine-spec.md records the boundary rule for M7 to M9
- [ ] #4 The rule is recorded as an ADR in docs/adr
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Boundary test in the engine workspace (gable-js-test262 tests/boundary.rs, the workspace tooling crate): via cargo metadata, every path package in the resolved graph lives under native/engine and is a workspace member; no dependency on a Gable framework crate (gable-designer, @gable packages). Red first by asserting against the current graph, then a vocabulary scan of crate sources and manifests for Gable framework terms (Host runtime, Renderer, @gable/, gable-ui, Gable Native, designer, template interpreter, gable:// scheme).
2. Fix what the scan finds: crate docs say 'embedder'/'host' instead of Host runtime and Gable error handler; QuickJS class GableHostObject -> HostObject; <gable-root> -> <root>; conformance kit test:// scheme instead of gable://.
3. Standalone check: scripts/check-standalone.mjs (Node) copies native/engine (excluding target, test262) to a temp dir and runs cargo build/test --workspace --locked there; run it locally.
4. CI: native-engine.yml job 'standalone' that copies native/engine to RUNNER_TEMP and builds and tests there.
5. ADR 0016 recording the boundary rule (the gable- prefix is the engine's working name; the one rename happens with the name decision in TASK-100.12); short note in docs/js-engine-spec.md section 10 for M7-M9.
