## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Record the constraints that keep a later JIT possible, as an ADR plus a short section in the engine spec, and check the current engine against them. Constraints to cover: frame layout and register mapping, stable per-site inline-cache feedback (shape metadata readable by a JIT), GC roots and write barriers a JIT can emit (stack maps or conservative scanning), explicit side-effect and exception boundaries for deoptimization, and a public embedding API that does not lock the engine to interpretation. Engine crates stay Gable-agnostic (ADR 0016).
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 An ADR in docs/adr records the JIT-readiness constraints and the tiering and deoptimization strategy, including the optional-feature decision and the platform story (macOS entitlement, iOS, locked-down Android, WASM)
- [ ] #2 The spec has a short section listing the constraints; every existing engine design that violates one is listed with a proposed fix, created as backlog tasks where worth doing
<!-- AC:END -->
