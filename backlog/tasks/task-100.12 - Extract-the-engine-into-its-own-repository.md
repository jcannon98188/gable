## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The engine is valuable as a release on its own: a pure-Rust, embeddable, test262-complete ES2025 engine with real Intl on ICU4X has no equivalent (Boa is the nearest and lags badly on Intl; the production engines are C/C++). The split waits until M9 (TASK-100.10) because M7 to M9 change the engine and Gable's adapter together and the switch-over gate runs Gable's suites against the engine, both far easier in one workspace. TASK-100.11 makes the split mechanical. History must be preserved: native/engine is already its own Cargo workspace, so a git subtree split carries its full history. Gable then consumes the engine as a git dependency pinned by revision; the engine CI (test262 baselines, intl402, GC stress, Miri, ASan) moves with it. Follow-up, to be ticketed after this and M7 when the adapter's real surface is visible: a generic embedding API (eval and module APIs, host functions, value handles with a documented lifetime story), semver policy, fuzzing corpus, security disclosure policy and embedder docs. A name and a license must be decided before the first external dependent.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 The new repository holds the full history of native/engine (subtree split), builds and passes its CI there with the test262 and intl402 baselines unchanged
- [ ] #2 Gable depends on the engine by pinned git revision; native/engine is removed from the Gable repository and Gable's own build, tests and native-engine CI pass against the dependency
- [ ] #3 The engine repository has a README, a license and the recorded name; ADRs that concern only the engine move with it and Gable's ADR index links to them
- [ ] #4 A follow-up task for the generic embedding surface exists, written from the adapter as it actually landed in M7 to M9

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Model assignment (maintainer, 2026-11-08): Sonnet for the mechanical rename to agnijs-* (scripted, verified by the ADR 0016 boundary tests and the standalone-export CI job) and the repository split. Creating the repository and any publishing needs the maintainer.

Ordering (maintainer, 2026-11-08): the extraction happens before the rest of the post-v1 work (TASK-101.2, 101.3, 101.5). Rename to agnijs-* and the agnijs-rs GitHub org apply here.
