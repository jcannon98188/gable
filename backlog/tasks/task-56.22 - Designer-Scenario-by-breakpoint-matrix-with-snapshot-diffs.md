## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Grid of every Scenario at chosen breakpoints using mountScene and the frame board; save baselines and show visual diffs against them. First check what already exists in packages/designer (and the devtools hook) so you build on it rather than duplicate; follow ADR 0001 (source is the truth, edits are minimal patches with undo), no fake data, protocol changes additive, MCP tools for anything an agent should drive, README section, driven headless check.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Matrix view; save baseline images; diff view highlights changes
- [ ] #2 Exposed through the MCP control plane where an agent would drive it
- [ ] #3 Tests added; tsc, designer build, full vitest and a headless Edge check pass
<!-- AC:END -->
