## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Star and Ldar are 50 to 60% of all executed instructions. Opcode histograms: loop-arith runs 69.0 M instructions for 3 M iterations of `s = (s + i * 7) % 1000003; i++` (23 per iteration; Star 30.4%, Ldar 26.1%), prop-monomorphic 35 per inner iteration (Star 37.1%, Ldar 20.0%), calls-recursive 20 per fib call (Star 32.5%, Ldar 17.5%). The compiler also emits ToNumeric for a postfix `i++` whose old value is unused (4.3% of loop-arith's instructions). Every instruction pays the dispatch cost (TASK-100.17), so the count multiplies it.

Reproduction: count instructions for loop-arith with a temporary opcode counter (the findings doc describes the one used), or compare bytecode dumps of the loop body before and after.

Benchmarks to prove it: loop-arith, loop-array-index, prop-monomorphic, calls-recursive (micro) and signal-churn, rxjs-operators (Gable).

Possible directions (the implementer decides): register-operand or immediate forms of the hot binary operators and comparisons, fused compare-and-jump, dropping unused ToNumeric, and a peephole pass over Star/Ldar pairs. A change to the instruction set changes the serialized bytecode, which needs a format tag bump and an ADR 0010 addendum; keep Instr small (12 bytes today).

Findings: docs/js-engine-performance-findings.md, finding 3. Keep the engine crates Gable-agnostic (ADR 0016); the agnijs-* rename is TASK-100.12, so use the current crate names. Measure before and after with the same binaries and machine; micro-benchmarks via `native/engine/target/release/bench.exe run --engine gable --engine quickjs` and `bench compare`, Gable benchmarks via `node native/engine-harness/js/run-bench.mjs --engine gable --engine quickjs`. The sampling profiler is native/tools/winprof (see the findings doc, Method).

Model assignment (maintainer, 2026-11-08, via TASK-100.14): Fable.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 loop-arith executes at least 35% fewer instructions per iteration, and calls-recursive at least 25% fewer per call
- [ ] #2 An unused postfix update no longer emits ToNumeric, with a compiler test
- [ ] #3 If the bytecode format changes, the serialization tag is bumped, old payloads are rejected as a format mismatch, and ADR 0010 has an addendum
- [ ] #4 test262 passes with no new failures or exclusions in both `--engine gable` and `--engine gable --precompile` runs, and the Gable suites pass under the Gable engine
- [ ] #5 The before and after numbers for the reproduction and the named benchmarks are recorded in the task notes, and no other micro-benchmark or Gable benchmark regresses by more than 5%
