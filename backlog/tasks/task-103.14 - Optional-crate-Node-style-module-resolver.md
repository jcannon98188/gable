## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
A Node-style module resolver and compatibility layer (package.json exports and imports, node_modules lookup, extension resolution) as a separate optional crate on the host module-loading interface, split out of the former TASK-103.13. Decide first whether it belongs in AgniJS or in embedder projects, and keep the engine core free of it. Model: Opus.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 A short ADR decides scope and ownership of a module resolver
- [ ] #2 If in scope: a separate crate with tests against a documented fixture set, and the engine core gains no dependency on it
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Model assignment (maintainer, 2026-11-08): Sonnet; the Node resolution algorithm is fully specified and a fixture suite checks the result.
<!-- SECTION:NOTES:END -->
