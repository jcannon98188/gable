## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Interpreter dispatch costs more than the work it dispatches. `Vm::step` is an out-of-line call per instruction whose prologue pushes eight registers, reserves 0x4D8 bytes of stack, saves xmm6 and sets up an EH state. The run loop (`interp/mod.rs`) tests four flags (`heap.stress`, `gc_requested`, `allocated_since_gc >= gc_threshold`, `debug_hot`) before every instruction, reads and writes `self.frames[fi].pc` with bounds checks, and `Flow::Reload` clones the `Rc<CodeBlock>` on every call and return. The accumulator lives in `self.frames[fi].acc` and registers in `self.regs[base + r]`, all bounds-checked. In loop-arith, the step prologue and epilogue are about 22% of samples and the run loop about 25%. `step` plus `run` self time is 26 to 55% of every Gable benchmark (signal-churn 55%, rxjs-operators 47%).

Reproduction: an empty `for (let i = 0; i < 1e6; i++) s += 1` loop in a module takes 129 ms against 37 ms on QuickJS-NG.

Benchmarks to prove it: loop-arith, prop-monomorphic, calls-recursive, method-calls (micro) and signal-churn, rxjs-operators, rxjs-subject-fanout (Gable).

This is independent of the bytecode-shape ticket (TASK-100.18), but the gains multiply. Keep the debugger hooks (`debug_hot`), GC safe points, the interrupt poll and the memory limit working; they can move behind one attention flag.

Findings: docs/js-engine-performance-findings.md, finding 2. Keep the engine crates Gable-agnostic (ADR 0016); the agnijs-* rename is TASK-100.12, so use the current crate names. Measure before and after with the same binaries and machine; micro-benchmarks via `native/engine/target/release/bench.exe run --engine gable --engine quickjs` and `bench compare`, Gable benchmarks via `node native/engine-harness/js/run-bench.mjs --engine gable --engine quickjs`. The sampling profiler is native/tools/winprof (see the findings doc, Method).

Model assignment (maintainer, 2026-11-08, via TASK-100.14): Fable.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 pc, accumulator and the register window are kept in locals of the dispatch loop and written back only where frames are observed (calls, returns, throws, safe points, debugger stops)
- [ ] #2 The per-instruction flag tests are replaced by a single check, and debugger stepping, breakpoints, interrupts, the memory limit and GC stress still work (their existing tests pass)
- [ ] #3 loop-arith and calls-recursive are at least 1.3x faster than at the start of the task
- [ ] #4 test262 passes with no new failures or exclusions in both `--engine gable` and `--engine gable --precompile` runs, and the Gable suites pass under the Gable engine
- [ ] #5 The before and after numbers for the reproduction and the named benchmarks are recorded in the task notes, and no other micro-benchmark or Gable benchmark regresses by more than 5%
